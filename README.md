# ML Parser :cyclone: # 

This repository contains all the needed code to parse the CSV files produced by [Grade Parser](https://github.com/acmauth/GradeParser) along with the CSV file produced by the students submissions (Google Forms).

**This repository is in WIP mode. Read carefully what each file does! Ask the authors for more information**

## Google Form Script Apps (google_form_filename.gs) :shit: ## 
These code is used inside the Google Forms app script to add an extract column to the initial submissions spreadsheet with the name of the file that has been submitted. This is needed since Google Forms saves the only the link to the file submitted by the user. 

## "Statistics Parser.ipynb" :baby: ##
Initial parsing of the grade submissions. It is meant only for research purposes and not for production environments. There are more info inside the notebook.
